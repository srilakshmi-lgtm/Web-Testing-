   - See requirement, timestamp, and result summary

3. **Search Tests**
   - Use the search box to find specific tests
   - Search by requirement text, script content, or results

4. **Pagination**
   - Navigate through multiple pages of results
   - 10 tests displayed per page

### Re-running Tests

1. **Find Test to Rerun**
   - Locate the test in history
   - Click the "Rerun" button

2. **Automatic Re-execution**
   - The system will regenerate and execute the test
   - New results will appear in history

### Downloading Test Scripts

1. **Download Option**
   - Click "Download" next to any test in history
   - Saves the script as a `.py` file

2. **Local Execution**
   - Run downloaded scripts locally with Python
   - Requires Playwright installation

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Requirements

#### Be Specific
❌ "Test the website"
✅ "Test login functionality on SauceDemo with username 'standard_user' and password 'secret_sauce'"

#### Include Expected Outcomes
❌ "Click the login button"
✅ "Click the login button and verify user is redirected to the products page"

#### Use Action-Oriented Language
- "Navigate to..."
- "Enter text..."
- "Click button..."
- "Verify that..."

#### Test Complete User Journeys
- Login → Search → Add to Cart → Checkout
- Registration → Email Verification → Login
- Form Submission → Validation → Success Message

### Browser Selection Guidelines

| Browser | When to Use | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Chrome/Chromium | Most websites, general testing | Fastest, most compatible |
| Firefox | Cross-browser validation | Good for compatibility testing |
| Safari/WebKit | macOS/iOS testing | Limited Windows support |

### Performance Considerations

- **Rate Limits**: 10 test generations per minute for developers
- **Execution Time**: Tests typically take 5-30 seconds
- **Timeout**: Maximum 5 minutes per test execution
- **Concurrent Users**: System handles multiple users simultaneously

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Generation Fails
**Problem**: Script generation returns an error
**Solutions**:
- Check your requirement is clear and specific
- Ensure internet connection for AI API
- Try rephrasing your requirement
- Contact admin if issue persists

#### Test Execution Fails
**Problem**: Script runs but test fails
**Solutions**:
- Review the analysis section for debugging info
- Check if the target website has changed
- Verify your requirement matches actual site behavior
- Try a different browser

#### Browser Launch Issues
**Problem**: Browser doesn't open or crashes
**Solutions**:
- Ensure Playwright browsers are installed
- Check system has sufficient resources
- Try a different browser
- Restart the application

#### Slow Performance
**Problem**: Tests take longer than expected
**Solutions**:
- Check internet connection
- Verify target website isn't slow
- Try during off-peak hours
- Contact admin for system issues

### Error Messages

#### "Access denied"
- You don't have permission for this action
- Check your user role with an admin

#### "Rate limit exceeded"
- You've made too many requests
- Wait a few minutes before trying again

#### "Invalid requirement"
- Your requirement doesn't meet validation rules
- Make it more specific (10-1000 characters)
- Use allowed characters only

#### "Execution timed out"
- Test took too long to complete
- Simplify your requirement
- Check target website responsiveness

- **Page Load Time**: < 3 seconds is good
- **Action Time**: < 1 second per action is ideal
- **Total Execution**: Varies by test complexity

#### Assertion Results
- **High Pass Rate**: > 80% indicates good test design
- **Failed Assertions**: Review error messages for issues
- **Step Coverage**: 100% completion is ideal

#### Accessibility Score
- **0 violations**: Perfect accessibility
- **1-5 violations**: Minor issues, review warnings
- **>5 violations**: Significant accessibility problems

## Security and Privacy

### Data Handling
- All test data is stored securely
- Passwords are hashed and never displayed

### Best Practices
- Don't include real passwords in test requirements
- Use test accounts for authentication testing
- Avoid testing on production systems without permission
- Be aware that browser automation may be detectable
